## 🎥 Movie Database App (React Native)

This project is a **mobile movie database app** that I developed based on a Figma design. The main goal is to allow users to search and view detailed information about thousands of movies using the **TMDB API**.

> ⚠️ This is an **incomplete version**, currently focused on building the movie details page and learning React Native navigation, API consumption, and component styling.
